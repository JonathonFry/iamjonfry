Hi, I'm Jon an Engineer living in Bath, UK.

I currently work as an Engineer at [Monzo](https://monzo.com/). I love solving product problems.

At work I mostly focus on Android engineering, but I love [go](https://go.dev/) - it's what I spend most of my tinkering with.

I've also spent time as an Engineering Manager, which I've[ written about on Monzo](https://monzo.com/blog/2022/05/06/becoming-an-engineering-manager-1-year-in).
