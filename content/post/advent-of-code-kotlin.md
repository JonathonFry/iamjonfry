In case you've been living under a rock for the last few months you will have seen that [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) reached a [1.0 release](http://blog.jetbrains.com/kotlin/2016/02/kotlin-1-0-released-pragmatic-language-for-jvm-and-android/) (Congratulations!).

Kotlin is a JVM language that has 100% interop with Java. This means that it can be used to develop for Android.

I had some time over the Christmas period to play about with Kotlin and loved it. I found it a breath of fresh air coming from the usual verbosity of Java.
I worked on some of the [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com/) challenges using Kotlin as a way to learn the language. I didn't complete all the challenges, interest seemed to fizzle when the Christmas booze ran out, however the code is up on github [here](https://github.com/JonathonFry/AdventOfCode).

*Spoiler alert - It's not idomatic Kotlin code..at all.*

I'm now in the process of converting an existing unreleased project to Kotlin and will blog about any interesting/challenging steps along the way.

P.S Another language plug - I've been writing a few micro services using [golang](https://golang.org/) and found it extremely powerful. Oh and the fact that their mascot is a gopher seals the deal.
