I have been keen to start learning some web development for quite some time but have been struggling with a place to start.
I have been learning bits and pieces on the backend with MongoDB and Node.js, but have always been frustrated when it came to developing on the frontend.

Enter AngularJS...
I have spent the better part of today playing around with AngularJS and its lovely. I have worked through the following tutorials and found them all great.

* [AngularJS in 30 minutes](http://www.revillweb.com/tutorials/angularjs-in-30-minutes-angularjs-tutorial/)
* [Setting up a mean stack single page application](http://scotch.io/bar-talk/setting-up-a-mean-stack-single-page-application)
* [Building a web app from scratch in AngularJS](http://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/building-a-web-app-from-scratch-in-angularjs--net-32944)




If you are interested in developing using MongoDb, NodeJS and AngularJS, I encourage you to check out [MEAN](http://mean.io/). They have developed a fullstack javascript framework using all of the above.
