Last year, the company I work at, Monzo, [introduced a 3 month paid sabbatical](https://www.ft.com/content/2c9b06d5-20cb-46a3-a570-2fc4d98f44b6) for all employees that reach 4 years of tenure.

I hit 4 years at Monzo in January of this year and broke my sabbatical into two:
- 6 weeks this year ~June
- 6 weeks next year ~August

I'm currently 3 weeks in.
